As you inspect the dimly lit foyer around yourself, you notice a caste iron door to your north with a brass knocker and engraved symbols.
 To your west lies a stout oaken bench with blood red cushions, it is pushed against the wall.
 To the east is plain ebony chest with a raven carved into it. 
 In the center of the room lies a large wax candle. The candle is unlit, but it looks like it has been lit before.

 You have 27 turns to escape.
>>open door

The door has been opened.
 You have 26 turns to escape.
>>go north

You exit the foyer, and the door slams loudly behind you with a CLICK. It doesn't seem to be openable again.
 You now find yourself in a small library with a single shelf of books. There is a mahogany desk in the center of the room. Although it seems like the desk is meant for studying, there are large scratch marks running along it and its corners have been gnawed off.
 There lies a pen and scroll on top of it.
 To your north, there is a similar caste iron door with a copper knocker. It seems to have different symbols engraved into it.

As you leave the small study, and the door slams loudly behind and then resounds with a loud CLICK. It seems to have locked automatically, so you cannot return to the library.
 You now find yourself in the large conservatory. There is another black to your north. It has a platinum knocker and the unmistakable symbol of the Baron's sigil.
 There are several broken down instruments. The only three that seem to function are a grand piano with a red velvet bench, and silvered trumpet, and a set of bongo drums with a taut skin. 
 There's also a stand with sheet music in the center of the room.
 You have 21 turns left.
>>play trumpet

With a triumphant TOOT, the trumpet plays.
 You have 20 turns left.

You see light trickle from the outside as you slowly push the heavy black iron door open. You have 17 turns left.
>>go north

Success! You're outside and away from danger. 
You have escaped the Baron's mansion with 16 spare turns, but will you be as lucky next time?
